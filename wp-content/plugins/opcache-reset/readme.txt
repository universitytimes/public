Automatic OPcache reset for WordPress. Invalidates both in-memory and file-based OPCache upon upgrading WordPress.

== Description ==

This plugin clears OPcache after updating WordPress core, themes, and files.
Unlike other plugins, it is also compatible with [WordPress updates made by Linux cron](https://www.getpagespeed.com/server-setup/performance-friendly-wordpress-updates).

### Features

* Automatic OPcache reset after plugin/theme/core updates
* Clears both memory-based and file-based OPcache
* Works with cron-based WordPress updates (CLI context)
* WP-CLI commands for manual OPcache management
* Zero external dependencies and no shell commands

### Configuration

The plugin works automatically for web-based updates. For CLI-based updates (cron, WP-CLI), configure your PHP-FPM socket:

Create a CacheTool-compatible `.cachetool.yml` in your WordPress root:

    adapter: fastcgi
    fastcgi: /run/php-fpm/www.sock

### WP-CLI Commands

Reset OPcache from the command line:

    wp opcache reset

Show OPcache status and statistics:

    wp opcache status

Output status as JSON:

    wp opcache status --format=json
