Optimize image sizes, regenerate thumbnails, enable retina, convert to WebP/AVIF, or use cloud optimization. An essential image toolkit.

== Description ==

**Perfect Images handles the basics of WordPress image management that should have been built-in from the start.** Manage image sizes, disable the ones you don't need, add custom sizes, and regenerate thumbnails in bulk. It's the essential foundation every WordPress install needs for clean, efficient image handling.

Think of it as your image management base layer. WordPress creates too many sizes? Disable them. Need a custom thumbnail size? Add it. Want retina support or modern formats like WebP/AVIF? Enable those modules. Perfect Images gives you complete control without bloat.

Explore [our official site](https://meowapps.com/wp-retina-2x) and check out [the tutorial](https://meowapps.com/wp-retina-2x/tutorial/) to get started.

== Core Features ==

⚙️ **Image Size Management**
The foundation of everything. View all registered image sizes (WordPress defaults, theme sizes, plugin sizes), disable the ones you don't need, and add custom sizes. Finally, control over those pesky WordPress-generated sizes like `medium_large`, `1536x1536`, and `2048x2048`.

🔄 **Regenerate Thumbnails**
Bulk regenerate thumbnails after changing sizes or switching themes. Progress tracking, smart processing, and automatic cleanup of old unused sizes.

🖼️ **Retina Images (Module)**
Optional module for high-DPI displays. Automatically generate and serve crisp @2x versions of your thumbnails. Works seamlessly with WordPress responsive images.

🎨 **Modern Formats (Module)**
Optional WebP/AVIF conversion. Convert images to modern formats for smaller file sizes and faster loading—without replacing your originals.

🚀 **Easy IO (Module)**
Optional CDN-based image optimization via EWWW. Automatically converts and delivers your images in WebP/AVIF, resizes on the fly, and serves them from a global CDN—zero server configuration required.

🤖 **AI Features (Module)**
Optional AI-powered tools. Upscale images via Claid.ai when your source is too small, or use the AI Assistant to analyze your sizes and recommend which to enable or disable based on your theme's srcset needs.

== 🖼️ Retina Images ==

Your visitors expect sharp, crisp images. Perfect Images makes retina support effortless.

**Smart Generation:**

* Automatic retina creation for all thumbnail sizes
* Multiple delivery methods (Responsive Images, PictureFill, Retina.js)
* Works with WordPress srcset natively
* Full-size retina support

**Delivery Options:**

* Responsive Images: Modern, standard method
* PictureFill: Hybrid approach with fallbacks
* Retina.js: Client-side detection
* Choose what fits your theme best

== 🎨 Modern Formats ==

WebP and AVIF offer dramatically better compression than JPEG/PNG—up to 50% smaller files with the same visual quality.

**What You Get:**

* Generate WebP or AVIF for any image size
* Automatic browser detection and fallbacks
* Works alongside your original images
* Enable for thumbnails or full-size
* Responsive Images delivery built-in

== 🤖 AI Features ==

Perfect Images integrates with AI services to help you manage and optimize your images smarter.

**AI Assistant:**

* Analyzes your image sizes and recommends which to enable or disable
* Detects redundant retina sizes already covered by other thumbnails
* Understands srcset behavior—sizes don't need to be pixel-perfect
* Requires [AI Engine](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ai-engine/) plugin

**Upscaling (via Claid.ai):**

* Generate retina images without 2x source files
* Create thumbnails larger than the original image
* Multiple upscaling modes (Smart Enhance, Digital Art, Photo, etc.)
* Automatic or manual processing

== ⚙️ Image Tools ==

The Image Tools dashboard lets you manage all your media in one place—regenerate thumbnails, build retina images, generate WebP/AVIF, and more, individually or in bulk.

**Regenerate Thumbnails:**

* Bulk regenerate all thumbnails
* Progress tracking for large libraries
* Preserves custom crops
* Updates retina and WebP versions automatically

**Replace Images:**

* Swap images directly from Media Library
* Drag & drop replacement in dashboard
* Maintains all metadata and links
* Updates all thumbnails instantly

**Manage Sizes:**

* View all registered image sizes
* Disable unwanted sizes (medium_large, 1536x1536, etc.)
* Create custom sizes
* Track which sizes are enabled per image

**Disable Image Threshold:**

* Stop WordPress from creating "-scaled" versions
* Keep your original full-size images intact

== Pro Features ==

* Full-size retina images
* Full-size WebP/AVIF conversion
* Priority support

== Why Perfect Images? ==

**Essential Foundation**
Every WordPress site needs proper image size management and thumbnail control. Perfect Images makes it simple, giving you the baseline image handling WordPress should have included.

**Modular & Lightweight**
Start with just image size management and thumbnail regeneration. Enable retina, WebP, Easy IO, or AI modules only when you need them. No bloat, no unnecessary features.

**Works with Everything**
Compatible with WooCommerce, page builders, galleries, and any theme. It uses WordPress's native image handling, so there are no conflicts.

**No Database Bloat**
Everything works through WordPress's existing metadata structure. No custom tables, no performance overhead.

**Built for Real Workflows**
Developed by someone who manages dozens of WordPress sites. Every feature solves a real problem we've encountered over years of WordPress development.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `wp-retina-2x-pro` to `/wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate through the 'Plugins' menu
3. Visit Perfect Images in your admin menu
4. Follow the **Setup Assistant** on the Overview tab—it walks you through configuring image sizes, retina, and optimization step by step
5. Enable additional modules as needed

For AI upscaling, sign up for [Claid.ai](https://claid.ai/pricing?via=meow) and add your API key. For CDN delivery, enable Easy IO and connect your site.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does Perfect Images slow down my site? =

No. Perfect Images processes images during upload or when you manually regenerate. There's no performance impact on the frontend—just optimized images served efficiently.

= Can I use WebP and Retina together? =

Absolutely! Perfect Images can generate both retina and WebP/AVIF versions of your images. Enable both modules and they work seamlessly together.

= Do I need AI for retina images? =

No. Perfect Images generates retina images from your uploaded originals by default. AI upscaling is optional—use it when you need to create retina versions larger than your source images.

= Which format should I use: WebP or AVIF? =

* **WebP**: Excellent browser support, great compression, safe choice for most sites
* **AVIF**: Better compression than WebP, but newer—check your visitor's browsers first

You can switch between them anytime in settings.

= Will this work with my page builder? =

Yes! Perfect Images works with WordPress's native image handling, so it's compatible with Elementor, Divi, Gutenberg, WooCommerce, and virtually any plugin or theme.

= Can I regenerate thumbnails for thousands of images? =

Yes! Perfect Images includes bulk regeneration with progress tracking. It handles large libraries efficiently.

= What happens to my existing images? =

Nothing, unless you choose to regenerate them. Perfect Images never modifies your original uploads—it creates additional optimized versions alongside them.

= Is this compatible with CDNs? =

Absolutely. Use the built-in Easy IO integration, or enter your own CDN domain in settings.

= Can I disable specific WordPress image sizes? =

Yes! Perfect Images lets you disable any registered size—WordPress defaults, theme sizes, plugin sizes—complete control.
